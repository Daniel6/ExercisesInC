# Exercise 2
## Pointers


1.  Read `stack.c`, which should be in this directory.  What is it
intended to do?  What would the output be if the program worked as
expected?

It appears to make two arrays, one with the number 42 as each element, and the other with each element having the number of that element's index. I would expect this to print out "42 42 42 42 42"

2.  Compile it.  Do you get a warning?  What does it mean?

The function foo is returning the address of an array that is local to foo(). I think this might create a problem if foo is called again later on.

3.  Run it.  What happens?  Can you explain it?  You might find it
helpful to draw a stack diagram.

Instead of "42 42 42 42 42" the program prints some random numbers. Since foo() returned the address of its local variable, and then finished, that variable went "out of scope" and as such was destroyed. However, there is no way to detect this outside of foo() as we are just given the address of the supposed array that foo() returns. Thus when we go to read the data in the array we find that it is not as expected since the original data has been destroyed.

4.  Comment out the `print` statements in `foo()` and `bar()` and run
it again.  What happens now?

The memory addresses of the local variable "array" in foo() and bar() is the same.

5.  Add comments to the code to explain these experiments and the results,
then check the code in to the repo.

Moral: Don't return pointers to stack allocated data!
