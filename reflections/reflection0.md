## Reflection

### Conglomeration of Individual and Team Goals

Each team member came to the team knowing that they shared one or two learning goals with at least one other member of the team. This helped in the formation of team goals. As a team we were primarily interested in networking, graphics processing, and high speed computing. Before deciding on becoming a team, we had discussed these goals and agreed that it was worth the minor inconvenience of not hitting every goal for the benefit of working with team members that we had had positive experiences with in the past.

### Division of Responsibilities

Noone really wanted to be the scrum master so I volunteered as I find being in a leader-ish position helps keep me involved since, as the person who says things like "so it seems like these are the things we need to work on for this sprint" it is easy to immediately follow up with "I would like to work on blah." As scrum master I also have extra responsibility to engage in the goings on of the team, which I have sometimes had trouble doing in the past. In a way this is my way of making sure I do my job and contribute to the team.

For other responsibilities such as who should do what, so far we have had people work on what they have an interest in. This has worked so far as our current objectives are just to learn about stuff and make basic frameworks bootstrapped from pre-existing code. In the future we may have to make sacrifices in personal enthusiasm to ensure that one person is not left alone to tackle a problem.

### Declaration of Sprint Backlog

For now we have accepted the vast majority of proposed work items, only pausing to refine vague jobs before adding them. This fits with our "shotgun" approach to finding a suitable method of exploring networking and specifically torrenting mechanics. Hopefully in the coming days some of the ideas we are investigating will pan out. 

As we start doing more and more coding, we will have to make sure that our sprint backlog does not contain large objectives that could really be broken into smaller pieces. 

### Apprehensions

I do not have many worries right now as I am confident in my team's ability to work together and pivot if necessary. I suppose the main threat right now is that we delay too long in coming together on a single project.
